The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development is responsible for overseeing production and consumption in the agricultural sector, creating agricultural value chains, and supplying agricultural inputs. However, the department of agriculture does not deliever the outmost services in the rural areas. The Agri Digital will offer a solution to the previously described issue. Chumisa will collaborate with the Department of Agriculture to address issues that rural farmers in the Eastern Cape experience, such as their lack of incentive to engage in farming because of the limited resources they have access to.
The proposed solution entails developing an information system that solve the problems mentioned above. Chumisa will function as follows. Farmers or citizens in the Eastern Cape can use our system for three services. For either looking for sponsorship, partnership and for getting news update about land reform and agriculture. A citizen who is looking for sponsorship will have to apply for the available funding. Our system will provide different types of agriculture sponsorship. Secondly a farmer who is looking for partnership will have to search for partnership or create a profile. Upon creating a profile a farmer will have to provide the personal and farming information. For a profile to be updated the farmer will have to make payment. Lastly a citizen who want to read more about land and agriculture will register to the system to get new update.
